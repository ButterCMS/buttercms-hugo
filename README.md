# ButterCMS Hugo Starter Project

This is a starter project for Hugo with integration of ButterCMS. This includes a posts generator written in Go which uses the ButterCMS SDK for Go to retrieve posts from ButterCMS.

## Important Notice
This project was created as an example use case of ButterCMS in conjunction with Hugo, and will not be actively maintained.
